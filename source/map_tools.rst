.. _ngcol_create_point:

Add a point
-----------

There are two ways to add a point in the application:

1. Mark it on the map (using a basemap, raster image, etc.)
2. Using the device's GPS coordinates

   Adding a point by GPS


After marking a point you can also set an attributive info and, if necessary, attach photos.
Confirmation of adding a point is done by clicking on the checkmark on the top panel
(for a map - first, you should save the location of the point with a "Floppy disk" icon in the same panel, after which the attribute information will open).
