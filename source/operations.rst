Working with projects
=====================

After a successful login, team member data collection will see a list of projects.
Suppose that a data collection project was created in Web GIS with a start page setting in the form of a list.
If you choose this test project NextGIS Collector mobile application displays a list of layers.
You can also switch to map mode.

and approaches are similar to those used in NextGIS Mobile.
